## Project Walkthrough

### Start Screen
Upon opening the app, users are greeted with a screen showcasing a variety of workout templates. At the bottom of the screen, a tab bar offers easy navigation to three main pages: Exercise Library, Start Workout, and _Progress*_.

When a user selects any of the available workout templates (such as Push, Pull, Legs1, Upper, or Legs2), a modal window appears. Within this modal, users can view detailed information about each exercise, including the exercise name, number of reps, and sets. Additionally, a convenient checkbox allows users to mark exercises as completed, facilitating tracking of completed exercise.

Moreover, users have the ability to track their engagement with each workout template, as the app displays the timestamp of their last access to a particular workout routine.

### Exercise Library Screen

The Exercise Library screen gives users access to a collection of exercises, complete with step-by-step instructions and visual guides for proper execution. Clicking on any exercise opens a modal with a detailed description. Users can also search for exercises or filter them by body part.
